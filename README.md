# core Flight System (cFS) Bundle Protocol Application (BPNode)

## Introduction

The cFS Bundle Protocol Application (BPNode) is a core Flight System (cFS) application that integrates the Bundle Protocol (BP) library ([BPLib](https://github.com/nasa/bplib)) with cFS to add RFC-9171 Bundle Protocol services to embedded space flight systems.

With BPNode, cFS can participate in a Delay/Disruption Tolerant Network (DTN) as a DTN Node. cFS BPNode communicates with other DTN nodes via BP.

## Software Required

cFS Framework (cFE, OSAL, PSP)
An integrated bundle including the cFE, OSAL, and PSP can be obtained at https://github.com/nasa/cfs
