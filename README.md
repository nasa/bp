# core Flight System (cFS) Bundle Protocol Application (BP)

## Introduction

The cFS Bundle Protocol Application (BP) is a core Flight System (cFS) application that integrates the Bundle Protocol (BP) library ([BPLib](https://github.com/nasa/bplib)) [- Modify when GitHub link is available -] with cFS to add RFC9171 Bundle Protocol services to embedded space flight systems.

With BP, cFS can participate in a Delay/Disruption Tolerant Network (DTN) as a DTN Node. cFS BP communicates with other DTN nodes via BP.

## Software Required
